<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Harshad Satra</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Frontend Enthusiast from India</h3>

I have been working as a Frontend Software Developer at DocuX for over three years, where I design and develop web applications and components using Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Node.js, AWS, and other technologies. DocuX is the first end-to-end document lifecycle management platform that empowers users to create, collaborate, control, and execute documents and contracts with ease and efficiency.

My passion for web development goes beyond aesthetics; I strive to create web experiences that are visually captivating, functionally seamless, SEO-friendly, fully accessible, and mobile-responsive. I have a strong background in UI/UX design, application programming interfaces, and web optimization, and I constantly explore new trends and technologies to enhance user satisfaction and engagement. I enjoy working with diverse and dynamic teams, and I'm always eager to learn from others and share my insights.
